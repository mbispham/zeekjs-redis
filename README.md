ZeekJS-Redis
=================================

This [zkg](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/zkg.html) package implements a method of parsing [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) logs to [Redis](https://redis.io/). [ZeekJS](https://zeekjs.readthedocs.io) is utilised to achieve this. Using a [Unix socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket) for data transmission, this package builds upon the [log-bypass](https://github.com/corelight/zeekjs/blob/main/doc/examples/log-bypass.js) example, to enhance storage options and faster data analysis.

## Installing and configuring the plugin

### Pre-requisites

You will need the following on your machine to install and configure the plugin (tip: see below how to build and use the supplied Docker container to try it out!).

- [Zeek > 6.0.2](https://github.com/zeek/zeek/blob/master/NEWS#L647) - Experimental ZeekJS supported as a builtin package
- [zkg](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html) Zeek package manager
- [redis-cli](https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/connect/cli/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
  - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
  - [redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis)
  - [safe-stable-stringify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-stable-stringify)
  - [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator)
  - [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston)


### Install zeekjs-redis plugin

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mbispham/zeekjs-redis.git
```

Install with `zkg`:
```
zkg install .
```

### Install all npm dependencies

The plugin will need some more `npm` modules which can be installed as follows:

```
npm install
```

Note: you might have to change the system `NODE_PATH` for Zeek to find the modules.

### Configure redis-server

You will need to have `redis-server` installed and running using a unixsocket. Check the documentation on your platform but usually this is done by editing `/etc/redis/redis.conf` and adding the following line:

```
unixsocket /var/run/redis/redis.sock
```

or another path of choice.

### Configure socketpath in plugin

The plugin will need to know the socketpath of the `redis-server`. If you have chosen another path than in the previous step, you will need to change the value of `ZEEKJS_REDIS_SOCKET_PATH` in the following file:

```
/usr/local/zeek/var/lib/zkg/clones/package/zeekjs-redis.git/scripts/.env
```

### Run Zeek on a pcap

**1. Run the test PCAP through Zeek:**
After installing the package run the test pcap with zeek.
```shell
zeek -C LogAscii::use_json=T -r <pcap>
```
`-C` avoids checksum errors, `LogAscii::use_json=T` enables JSON formatted logs. Note, if installing from a local git pull, the pathway is likely:

```
PREFIX_PATH=$(zeek-config --prefix)
FULL_PATH="${PREFIX_PATH}/var/lib/zkg/clones/package/zeekjs-redis"
```

**2. Access Redis using the CLI:**
Connect to Redis through the Unix socket to query the results.
```shell
redis-cli -s /var/run/redis/redis.sock
```

**3. View the keys stored in Redis:**
Check what keys are in Redis after running Zeek.
```
redis /var/run/redis/redis.sock> KEYS *
1) "zeek_packet_filter_logs"
2) "zeek_conn_logs"
```

**4. Retrieve log data from Redis:**
Fetch the stored conn logs.
```
redis /var/run/redis/redis.sock> LRANGE zeek_conn_logs 0 -1
```

Example Output:
```
1) "{\"ts\":1616775350.763199,\"uid\":\"XXX\",\"id\":{\"orig_h\":\"192.168.220.35\",\"orig_p\":53537,\"resp_h\":\"192.168.220.1\",\"resp_p\":31981},\"proto\":\"tcp\",\"conn_state\":\"S0\",\"local_orig\":true,\"local_resp\":true,\"missed_bytes\":0,\"history\":\"S\",\"orig_pkts\":1,\"orig_ip_bytes\":44,\"resp_pkts\":0,\"resp_ip_bytes\":0}"
...
24) "{\"ts\":...
```

## Build and use Docker image

You can also try ZeekJS-redis using Docker! To do so, make sure you have Docker installed and build the image:

```shell
docker build .
```

Then start the container with

```shell
docker run -it <id>
```

This will start `redis-server` and drop you into a `bash` shell. From here you can test the supplied pcap using:

```shell
root@xxxxx:~$ zeek -Cr zeekjs-redis-test.pcap
```

Output will be like this:
```
info: Connected to Redis successfully. {"label":"index.js","timestamp":"2024-05-13 19:39:15"}
info: Connected to Redis through Unix socket. {"label":"index.js","timestamp":"2024-05-13 19:39:15"}
info: Log stream policy hook setup successfully. {"label":"index.js","timestamp":"2024-05-13 19:39:15"}
Main function completed successfully.
```

Refer to [here](##Run-Zeek-on-a-pcap) to learn how to retrieve the values from `redis`.


### Filtered Log Usage

If the intention is to export specific fields from Zeek logs to Redis, an example modification to `index.js` is outlined below:

```
  ...
  logID = logID.replace(/([a-z0-9])([A-Z])/g, '$1_$2').toLowerCase();

  const logFile = `${logID}.log`;
  const redisKey = `zeek_${logID}_logs_orig_ip_bytes`;
  const logRec = zeek.select_fields(logData, zeek.ATTR_LOG);
  if (!('orig_ip_bytes' in logRec)) {
    return;
  }

  const origBytes = logRec.orig_ip_bytes;
  const serializedData = stringify(origBytes);
  ...
```
